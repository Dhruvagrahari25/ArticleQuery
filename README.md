### Introducing ArticleQuery

Have you ever wished you could ask questions about a long article and someone could just give you answers from that article?

## ArticleQuery: Your Web Article Question-Answering Companion

This project allows you to interactively query any article on the web by simply providing its URL. Using a combination of advanced technologies, it processes the article's content and enables you to get precise answers to your questions.

## Tech Stack/Tools

- **Python:** The core programming language used for the application logic.
- **Google's Gemini API:** Powers the natural language processing capabilities to understand and generate responses.
- **Langchain:** Facilitates communication between the user queries and the NLP model.
- **Streamlit:** Provides an intuitive and interactive user interface for inputting URLs and querying articles.

## Components and Their Roles

### Python
Python is the backbone of the project, handling all the application logic. It manages the flow of data between different components, processes user inputs, and ensures smooth operation.

### Google's Gemini API
The Gemini API is the key to understanding and processing the content of the articles. It leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to comprehend the text and generate relevant, accurate answers to user queries.

### Langchain
Langchain acts as the intermediary between user questions and the NLP model. It translates user queries into a form that the model can understand and then processes the model's responses to provide clear and concise answers.

### Streamlit
Streamlit offers a user-friendly interface where users can input the URL of the article they want to query. It also provides the platform for displaying the interaction, making it easy for users to see the answers to their questions in real-time.

## How It Works

1. **Input URL:** Users enter the URL of the web article they want to query.
2. **Fetch and Process:** The application fetches the content of the article and processes it using the Gemini API.
3. **Ask Questions:** Users can ask any questions related to the content of the article.
4. **Get Answers:** Langchain facilitates the interaction with the Gemini API to generate accurate answers, which are then displayed through Streamlit.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ArticleQuery.git
   cd ArticleQuery
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Streamlit interface in your web browser.
2. Enter the URL of the article you want to query.
3. Ask your questions in the provided input box.
4. View the responses generated by the application.

## Conclusion

ArticleQuery makes it easy to extract and understand information from long articles on the web. By leveraging Python, Google's Gemini API, Langchain, and Streamlit, this project provides a seamless and efficient way to interact with web content.
